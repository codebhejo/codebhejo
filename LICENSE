Preamble

The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.

When a program is modified and run on a server and users interact with
it remotely through a computer network, the Affero General Public
License requires the operator of the server to provide the source code
of the modified version running there to the users of that server.

This Public License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it is licensed under this
Public License.
